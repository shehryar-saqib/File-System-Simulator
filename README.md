# File System Simulator

A C++ project that simulates basic file system operations, including file creation, deletion, directory navigation, and hierarchical management. This educational tool replicates the core behavior of a UNIX-like file system, enabling users to understand and interact with concepts like inodes, directory structures, and path traversal.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

The simulator is designed to model how low-level file systems function without relying on actual disk storage. It provides a command-line interface to mimic real-world operations, making it ideal for learning and demonstration purposes in systems programming.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* Hierarchical directory structure (root, subfolders, files)
* Create, delete, and navigate directories and files
* Path resolution for both absolute and relative paths
* Simple in-memory file management
* Command interface similar to basic Unix shell commands

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Outcomes

* Understanding file system tree structures and traversal
* Implementing inodes, file descriptors, and path parsing
* Applying principles of system-level file operations in C++

## ðŸ§ª Sample Commands

* `mkdir dir1` â€“ Create a new directory
* `touch file1.txt` â€“ Create a new file
* `cd dir1` â€“ Navigate into directory
* `ls` â€“ List current directory contents
* `rm file1.txt` â€“ Remove a file
* `pwd` â€“ Show current path
